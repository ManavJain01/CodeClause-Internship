## Shopping cart

The Shopping Cart project is a web-based application designed to simulate an online shopping experience, allowing users to browse products, add them to a cart, and complete purchases. It features a user-friendly homepage with navigation, product listings in a grid layout, detailed product pages, and a shopping cart that summarizes selected items. The checkout page includes a form for user information and payment details. Built using HTML and CSS, the project emphasizes responsive design to ensure accessibility across devices, providing an engaging interface while showcasing essential web development skills.
