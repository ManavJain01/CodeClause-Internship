I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Application (MCA) from the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Raipur, and I have completed my graduation from Jiwaji University, Gwalior. I have a passion for frontend development and have been working on various full stack projects using the MERN stack.

* The Shopping Cart project is a web-based application designed to simulate an online shopping experience, allowing users to browse products, add them to a cart, and complete purchases.
* It features a user-friendly homepage with navigation, product listings in a grid layout, detailed product pages, and a shopping cart that summarizes selected items.
* The checkout page includes a form for user information and payment details. Built using HTML and CSS, the project emphasizes responsive design to ensure accessibility across devices, providing an engaging interface while showcasing essential web development skills.

## Exam Management System
* I developed an Exam Management System using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and Tailwind CSS to provide a seamless and responsive user experience.
* Features:
    1. Authentication:
    * Users can sign up and log in securely to access the system.
    * Authentication is implemented with JWT tokens for secure session handling.

    2. Examination:
    * Users can take a 10-question exam with an interactive and user-friendly interface.
    * Questions are fetched dynamically from the backend, ensuring variety in each session.

    3. Instant Results:
    * After completing the exam, users receive their results instantly, including the score and a breakdown of their performance.

    4. Logout Functionality:
    * Users can log out securely, ensuring the safety of their account and session data.

    5. Responsive Design:
    * The system is designed with Tailwind CSS, ensuring it works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

    6. Data Management:
    * Exam data and user records are stored in MongoDB, allowing efficient data retrieval and scalability.
